Program: 3.2

---

**Program Name:**  
Sorting Three Numbers in Ascending Order

---

**Objective:**  
To implement a C program that takes three numbers as input and arranges them in ascending order using conditional statements and swapping technique.

---

**Algorithm:**  
1. Start the program.
2. Declare three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` to store the input numbers and a temporary variable `temp` for swapping.
3. Accept input values for `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user.
4. Compare `a` and `b`; if `a > b`, swap their values using `temp`.
5. Compare `b` and `c`; if `b > c`, swap their values using `temp`.
6. Compare `a` and `c`; if `a > c`, swap their values using `temp`.
7. Display the sorted values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
8. End the program.

**Program Code:**

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    int a, b, c, temp;
    printf("Enter Three Numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);

    if (a > b) { temp = a; a = b; b = temp; }
    if (b > c) { temp = b; b = c; c = temp; }
    if (a > c) { temp = a; a = c; c = temp; }

    printf("Ascending order: %d %d %d", a, b, c);
    return 0;
}
```

**Result Analysis:**  
The program successfully sorts three input numbers in ascending order by comparing and swapping them through conditional statements. It ensures that no matter the initial order of the numbers, the output is always arranged from the smallest to the largest.
