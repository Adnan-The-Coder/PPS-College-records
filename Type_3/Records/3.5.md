Program: 3.5

---

**Program Name:**  
Finding the Greatest of Three Numbers

---

**Objective:**  
To implement a C program that determines the greatest of three numbers using the conditional (ternary) operator.

---

**Algorithm:**  
1. Start the program.  
2. Declare three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c` to store the input numbers.  
3. Accept input values for `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user.  
4. Use the conditional (ternary) operator to find the greatest number:  
   - Compare `a` and `b`. If `a > b`, then compare `a` with `c`; otherwise, compare `b` with `c`.  
   - Assign the greatest value to the variable `greatest`.  
5. Display the greatest number.  
6. End the program.

**Program Code:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    printf("Enter three numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);

    int greatest = (a > b) ? (a > c ? a : c) : (b > c ? b : c);
    printf("Greatest number: %d\n", greatest);

    return 0;
}
```

**Result Analysis:**  
The program correctly identifies the greatest of three input numbers using the conditional (ternary) operator. It is an efficient and compact method for such comparisons.
