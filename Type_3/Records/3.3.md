Program: 3.3

---

**Program Name:**  
Finding the Grade of a Student

---

**Objective:**  
To implement a C program that takes marks as input and assigns a grade based on the marks using conditional statements.

---

**Algorithm:**  
1. Start the program.  
2. Declare an integer variable `marks` to store the student's marks.  
3. Accept the marks from the user.  
4. Use conditional statements to determine the grade:  
   - If marks are 90 or above, assign grade `A`.  
   - If marks are between 80 and 89, assign grade `B`.  
   - If marks are between 70 and 79, assign grade `C`.  
   - If marks are between 60 and 69, assign grade `D`.  
   - If marks are below 60, assign grade `F`.  
5. Display the grade.  
6. End the program.

**Program Code:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int marks;
    printf("Enter marks: ");
    scanf("%d", &marks);

    if (marks >= 90) {
        printf("Grade: A\n");
    } else if (marks >= 80) {
        printf("Grade: B\n");
    } else if (marks >= 70) {
        printf("Grade: C\n");
    } else if (marks >= 60) {
        printf("Grade: D\n");
    } else {
        printf("Grade: F\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```

**Result Analysis:**  
The program successfully assigns a grade to the student based on the input marks. It uses a series of conditional checks to categorize the marks into grades ranging from `A` to `F`.
